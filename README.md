# RTR-5.0-on-android

The RTR 5.0 (Real-Time Rendering 5.0) repository contains a comprehensive collection of OpenGL assignments based on AstroMediComp’s(https://www.astromedicomp.org/) Real-Time Rendering (RTR) course, conducted from April 2023 to October 2024.

This repository features implementations of modern OpenGL techniques, covering topics such as:
    •	Basic OpenGL setup using the Android SDK
	•	Shader programming (vertex, fragment, geometry, tessellation)
	•	3D transformations & projections (model-view-projection, perspective, orthographic)
	•	Lighting models (diffuse, Phong, Blinn-Phong, per-vertex, per-fragment)
	•	Texture mapping (basic textures, procedurally generated textures)
	•	Framebuffers & post-processing

This repository is a valuable resource for students and professionals interested in enhancing their understanding of real-time rendering and OpenGL development on Android.
